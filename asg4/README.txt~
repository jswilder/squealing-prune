Running times -

	Constructor - O( n^2 )

		because the largest amount of work was finding the smallest value, where
		it searches through the entire array, almost everything else seems to be a
		constant time. The one part that isn't is where I manipulate the array, but
		I think that takes time O( n ) and therefore wouldn't affect the overall runtime
		in the grand scheme of things

	Dump - O( n )

		it is proportional to the number of nodes stored, which is size-1 

	Compare - O( n^2 )

		it compares every node against each other, n nodes compared against n nodes
		= n*n or n^2

	Destructor - O( n )

		because it would take time proportional to the number of nodes in the vector
		to delete the memory. It will always delete only one word from the "words"
		vector because that is all that will remain
