1) 		| 3	|     | 5 |	     | 7 |
	1 2       3 4       5  6       7 8 9

2) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

3) It is the constant K, at most each root will contain that amout, minimum of k/2

4) It allows you to call the appropriate dump for the inherited class being called

5) It's used to split the root, maintaining the size K
		If it returns NULL it splits the root making new ones

6) It splits the root and divides the children between them

7) To show that it isn't actually being used, it lets the compiler know not to
		search for the implementation code

8) The good is it allows you to modify the code in a derived class

	Scholars maintain the bad parts behind this method were lost long ago
